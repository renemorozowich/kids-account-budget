# Kids Account Budget

My final project for the [JavaScript for WP Bootcamp](https://www.javascriptforwp.com/bootcamp) is a budgeting app where kids can allocate the total in their checking account (or piggy bank) to various categories.

## Categories

On setup, the user would choose budget categories meaningful to them (like clothes, entertainment, eating out, gifts, etc).

Categories will show on a categories page or section of the home page.

### Budget

An amount will be shown next to each category based on the transactions (see below). The total amount of all categories = the actual amount in the account.

## Transactions

There will be a button to add a new transaction (on a page or section of the page).

Each transaction can be positive (income) or negative (expense). There will be fields for date (date picker), category (dropdown), description (text) and amount (decimal).

On save, the transaction is recorded and the total for the category is updated.

All transactions will show (on a transactions page or section of the home page).

# Future Versions

* Save to a database instead of local storage
* Move budgeted money between categories
* Add login capabilities
* When entering a new transaction, allow the user to choose more than one category
* Edit or delete categories
* Edit or delete transactions
* Add place/store and dropdown
* Only show transactions based on month or time range (when there are many)
* Possible: break budget down into monthly groupings
