# Kids Account Budget

My final project for the [JavaScript for WP Bootcamp](https://www.javascriptforwp.com/bootcamp) is a budgeting app where kids can allocate the total in their checking account (or piggy bank) to various categories.

## Categories

On setup, the user can add budget categories meaningful to them (like clothes, entertainment, eating out, gifts, etc).

Categories show in the left sidebar.

### Budget

An amount is shown next to each category based on the transactions (see below). The total amount of all categories = the actual amount in the account.

## Transactions

Previously entered transactions will show and include category, description and amount. All transactions will show in the content area.

To delete a transaction, double-click on the row.

There is a form to add a new transaction and on save, the transaction is recorded and the total for the category is updated.
